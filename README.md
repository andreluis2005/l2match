# 🧠 L2Match – Discover Your Perfect Ethereum L2

**L2Match** is a fun and interactive quiz that helps users discover which Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution best matches their personality and needs. Built with [Base Minikit](https://base.org/minikit), this app is designed to engage the community while showcasing the power of decentralized applications.

## 🔍 What It Does

L2Match asks a series of multiple-choice questions to determine a user’s ideal Ethereum L2 (like Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, etc.). At the end, users receive:

- Their L2 “Soulmate”
- A breakdown of scores for each L2
- Option to mint their result onchain

---

## 💡 Inspiration

Inspired by Buzzfeed-style personality quizzes and the growing Ethereum L2 ecosystem, L2Match makes learning about rollups and L2s fun and accessible. This project was submitted to **Base Batches #001 – Global Buildathon** with a focus on community engagement and gamified discovery.

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), TailwindCSS, and [Base Minikit](https://base.org/minikit)
- Quiz data stored offchain using Redis
- Results are minted onchain to the Base network via smart contracts
- Works as a standalone app and intended to integrate with Farcaster as a Mini App
